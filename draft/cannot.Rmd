One small thing `nse` can't do.

Because `nse` returns to the user not the raw PROMSXP or DOTSXP, but a
representations thereof, by using NSE one ends up copying promise
objects, rather than transferring them. This means that one side
effect of R's lazy evaluation can't be easily replicated.


```{R}
f <- function(...) {
  g(...)
  list(g(...), ...)
}
```

```{R}
f <- function(...) {
  g(...)
}
```

If we try to replicate the recursive call using `nse` constructors, we
find that this effect is not duplicated.

```{R}

```
