title: How To Do Things With Non-Standard Evaluation
---

"Non-standard evaluation" is the name the R community gives to
techniques that subvert the normal order of evaluation in the R
language.

Things that are standard evaluation:
    * Calling functions
    * Returing a value from a function

Things that are non-standard evaluation:

The most common case of non-standard evaluation occurs e.g. in
plotting functions, where. If this is your use case, just use arg_expr.

# What is Standard Evaluation?

Consider the following R code

```{R}

plot_with_mean <- function(x, ...) {

}

recenter_median <- function(x, ...) {
  tmp <- mean(x)
}

recenter_mode <- function(x, ...) {
  tmp <- mode(x)
  x=x, ...
}

list <- function(x, ...) {
  
}
```

# What

## Trivial non-standard evaluation

```{R}

```

# Information about the present call

## Information about the arguments to the call

### How was the argument written?

```

```
### What environment did the argument come from?

```

```

### What are all the arguments to the function?

```
as.args(environment())
```

## Information about the call itself

### What is the function being evaluated

### What was this function called, in the caller?

Note that functions do not have a "name" in R as such. Functions may
be bound to a name in a particular environment, and they

### How was this call written, in the caller's code?

```{R}
call_expr(capture_call())
```

This is OK for generating plot labels and debugging labels, but if you are
implementing NSE you should almost certainly use [capture_call] instead.

### What environment was the present function called from?

Note: this is NOT necessarily the same as what environments the
arguments are from. If your function has an argument, 9 times out of
ten it's [the environment of the arg] that you want to know.

```
caller()
call_env(capture_call())
env(capture_call()[[1]])
```

### Capture a version of this call and all its arguments, unevaluated

```
capture_call()
```

## Information about other calls

Recall that every time a function is called, an R environment object is created.

# Construct, modify or invoke arguments.

# Bind a lazy value

```
set_arg(x, quo(x+1))
set_arg(x, quo(x+1))
set_arg(x, quo_(quote(x+1), environment())
```
# Bind a lazy value in another environment

# Make a lazy variable from some expression

# Assign a lazy variable to some name

# Create an argument list from expression objects

# Create an argument list from promises

# Create a list of arguments

## Create a call from a function and arguments

call(function, as.args(x+1))
