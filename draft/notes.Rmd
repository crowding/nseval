In R, arguments have tags, as opposed to just lists.
You need to be able to substitute into the tags of a call.

Let's say that we wanted to have a statement "foreach" that worked
like "for" but accumulated and returned the results in a list. So an
example usage would look like:

```r
sum <- 0
parts <- foreach(i, 1:3, {
  sum <- sum + i
  sqrt(i)
})
```

Following the principle of least surprise, let's say we want foreach
to work similarly to `for` and mimic R's quirks regarding `for`:
That each iteration of the body is and the placeholder variable `i` is
defined in the environment enclosing the `for` statement.

```r
vec <- i
out <- vector(length(i), list)
for (iter in seq(len(values))) {
  i <- vec[[iter]]
  out[[iter]] <- {
    sim(a)
  }
}
```

So far so good. What happens when we want to nest two foreach loops?


```

```



```r
out <- function(x)

x <- function(i)
```
