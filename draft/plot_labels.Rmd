title: How to Save Function Arguments, Generate Plot Labels, and Transparently Wrap Functions
---

These are the most common (and least problematic) scenarios for where
the R user normally encounters or needs metaprogramming:

* Present to the user the same expressions that appear in the R code.
  For example, automatically generating plot labels.

* Saving information about how a function was called, so as to re-call
  it later. For example, model objects that allow derived models and
  application of different data.

* Forwarding your "raw" arguments to another function, which itself
  uses metaprogramming.
  * For example, if you want to write a wrapper function around plot().

```{R}
line.plot <- function(x, y, ...) {
  plot(x, y, ...)
}
```

```{R}
line.plot <- function(x, y, ...) {
  args <- get_call()
  
  args <- c(args(x=x, y=y), dots(...))
  
  plot %()% args
}
```

```{R}
line.plot <- function(x, y, ...) {
  
}
```
